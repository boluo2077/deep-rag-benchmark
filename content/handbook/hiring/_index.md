At the core of our team's vision, mission, and strategy is our ability to impact GitLab's overarching [mission](/handbook/company/mission/): to make it so that **everyone can contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world**. When **everyone can contribute**, users become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of innovation.

As a Talent Acquisition team, we have an outsized impact on GitLab's ability to make this mission a reality, by connecting top talent to profound careers from wherever they are in a truly distributed, remote workforce.

### Talent Acquisition Vision Statement

To create globally inclusive access to opportunities so that **everyone can contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world**.

### Talent Acquisition Mission Statement

It is the Talent Acquisition Team's mission to predictably build distributed, representative teams that enable team members to **co-create** the future of software.

### Our Guiding Principles

As we set out to achieve this vision, we will continue to rely on core guiding principles to define how we build toward the future.

1. **Experience**: Stakeholder experience is central to our craft. We are a partner, an advisor, and an essential component to building high performing teams and culture at GitLab.
1. **Inclusivity**: We design fair and equitable processes into the fabric of what we do. We believe Talent Acquisition has an outsized impact on the make-up of our teams, and we strive to continue to build them with inclusivity as a integral piece of our craft.
1. **Predictability**: Our ability to have the right team members, in the right roles, at the right time is imperative to execute on our commitments and plans as an organization. We strive for predictability: to build accuracy in our forecasts and enable the business to look around corners through strong relationships and data driven decision making.

### Our Objectives and Roadmap

We strive to be as transparent as possible, but these sections are only available for our GitLab team members.

<summary>Shared Definitions</summary>

- **Job:** A job refers to the job title (ex: Customer Support Specialist). This will also be what appears on external job boards. In the case there are multiple positions open that are the same, and we only want to list once, we can have multiple 'openings' (see next section) opened within one 'Job'. Each job will have a unique identifier called a Requisition ID (example- 1001).
- **Opening:** A job can have multiple openings attached to it (ex: you are hiring 3 Customer Support Specialists. You would then have 1 'Job' and 3 'openings' against that job). A job can have multiple openings against it, but an opening can not be associated with multiple jobs. Each opening will have a unique identifier called an Opening ID (example- 1001-1, 1001-2, 1001-3).
- **GHPiD:** GHP ID is the link between Adaptive (what we use to track our operating plan) and Greenhouse (our ATS). A GHP ID has a one to one relationship with an Opening ID. It is the key interlock between our hiring plans and our Talent Acquisition activity. This is a custom field in Greenhouse.

<summary>PEO information and timelines</summary>

- For candidates who are located in Countries where we do not have an entity, we use a PEO (Professional Employment Organization).  The actual employment contracts will be sent and issued by the PEO who also handles the processing and payment of payroll and associated taxes and compliance in each of the countries on behalf of GitLab. The contracts themselves are between the individual and the PEO.
- The following timelines to onboarding are advised:
